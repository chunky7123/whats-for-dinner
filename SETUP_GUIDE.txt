Notes:
- TheMealDB is used for online recipe search (no API key required).
- Ads are placeholder elements. To add real ads later, integrate Google AdMob (for native apps) or an ad provider for web banners.
- To distribute in app stores later, wrap the PWA using Capacitor or use PWABuilder to generate store packages.
